I have chosen to build a tool for **managing supplements+emails** within my **own personal website!** (so two projects in one and I actually am very excited (:).

## The subtasks can be decomposed as follows:
1. Design different week cycles with different supplements.
2. Keep track of the supplements used and remaining stock.
3. Implement notification reminders for taking supplements and restocking.
4. Create a password-protected personal website.
5. Integrate a supplement manager and a bill payment manager.
6. Add a package manager and a tool to replace text.
7. Include a makeshift checklist, kanban board, and note-taking functionality.
8. Explore the possibility of integrating an email manager.
9. Incorporate an AI API + Wolfram/Mathematica AI integration. (this one I may scrap due to complexity, and the probability this project will become redundant in the [very close future](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/chatgpt-gets-its-wolfram-superpowers/)â€¦ OpenAI must have stolen my idea from my FP Details and Timeline assignment :./).

## Out of these subtasks, the computational subtasks can be identified as follows:

### 1. Explore the possibility of integrating an email manager:
   * Implementing an email management API that allows users to manage emails using the website, seeing that we can use testmail.app this seems like a very good idea.
   * Check for Leverett Package Centre emails?, could also act as a package notifier??
   * This seems to be an easy addition to my overall project.
   
### 2. #Keep track of the supplements used and remaining stock:
   * This task can be solved computationally by implementing a database system that keeps track of the supplements' usage and stock levels.
   * Using an algorithm that sends reminders to my phone or email based on the consumption pattern of the supplements? 
   * [This one _also_ seems good!](https://web.dev/push-notifications-in-all-modern-browsers/)

I will aim to incorporate both within the website I create, but for now I may probably start with the email manager, (since I can probably finish that one first). Hopefully it goes well :)
